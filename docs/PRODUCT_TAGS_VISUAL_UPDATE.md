# Product Tags Visual Update

## Overview
Added visual badges for "Runner" and "Best Seller" products on the product cards, similar to the existing promotions badge.

## Changes Made

### File Modified
- ✅ `src/components/customer/NewOrderProductList.tsx`

### What Changed
Added visual tags/badges that appear next to the product title in product cards:

#### Badge Colors & Meanings:
1. **🔴 Promotions** (Red Badge)
   - Background: `bg-red-100`
   - Text: `text-red-800`
   - Shows: `t('products.promotions')` → "מבצעים"

2. **🔵 Runner** (Blue Badge) - **NEW**
   - Background: `bg-blue-100`
   - Text: `text-blue-800`
   - Shows: `t('products.runner')` → "Runner"
   - Condition: `product.is_runner === true`

3. **🟢 Best Seller** (Green Badge) - **NEW**
   - Background: `bg-green-100`
   - Text: `text-green-800`
   - Shows: `t('products.bestSellers')` → "בסט סלר"
   - Condition: `product.is_best_seller === true`

### Visual Layout

**Before:**
```
[Product Image] iPhone 17 Pro Max [מבצעים]
```

**After:**
```
[Product Image] iPhone 17 Pro Max [מבצעים] [Runner] [בסט סלר]
```

Products can have **multiple badges** at the same time:
- A product can be a **Promotion + Runner + Best Seller** (all 3 badges)
- Or any combination of these badges

### Implementation Details

#### Mobile Layout (lines 226-245):
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-1 flex-wrap">
  <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-gray-900 leading-tight">
    {product.brand} {product.model}
  </h3>
  {product.is_promotion && (
    <span className="...bg-red-100 text-red-800">
      {t('products.promotions')}
    </span>
  )}
  {product.is_runner && (
    <span className="...bg-blue-100 text-blue-800">
      {t('products.runner')}
    </span>
  )}
  {product.is_best_seller && (
    <span className="...bg-green-100 text-green-800">
      {t('products.bestSellers')}
    </span>
  )}
</div>
```

#### Desktop Layout (lines 326-345):
Same implementation as mobile, with slightly smaller text.

### Key Features

1. **✅ Responsive Design**
   - Works on both mobile and desktop layouts
   - Added `flex-wrap` to allow badges to wrap to a new line if needed

2. **✅ Color Coding**
   - Each badge type has a distinct color for easy recognition
   - Consistent with the filter button colors

3. **✅ Conditional Rendering**
   - Badges only show if the product has the corresponding flag set to `true`
   - No badge clutter - only relevant tags are shown

4. **✅ i18n Support**
   - All badge text uses translation keys
   - Works in both English and Hebrew

5. **✅ Multiple Badges**
   - Products can have multiple badges simultaneously
   - Example: iPhone 17 Pro Max can be [מבצעים] [Runner] [בסט סלר]
