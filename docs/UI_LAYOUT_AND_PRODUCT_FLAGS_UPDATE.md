    WHEN is_runner THEN 'Runner Only'
    WHEN is_best_seller THEN 'Best Seller Only'
    ELSE 'Regular Product'
  END as product_type
FROM public.products
WHERE is_runner = true OR is_best_seller = true
ORDER BY brand, model, storage;
```

**Count the Results:**
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_runner = true) as runner_count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_best_seller = true) as best_seller_count,
