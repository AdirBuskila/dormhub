   SELECT 
     brand,
     model,
     storage,
     is_runner,

       WHEN is_best_seller THEN 'Best Seller Only'
       ELSE 'Regular Product'
     END as product_type
   FROM public.products

     brand,
     CASE 
       WHEN is_runner AND is_best_seller THEN 1

     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_best_seller = true) as best_seller_count,
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_runner = true AND is_best_seller = true) as both_count
   FROM public.products;
   ```

## Expected Results

After running this migration, you should see:

- **~80-100 Best Sellers** - Proven products across all price ranges
- **~15-20 Both** - Premium products that are new AND selling extremely well

## Business Impact

### For Customers (New Order Page)
- **"Runner" Filter** - Shows only the hottest new products that just launched
- **"Best Seller" Filter** - Shows proven products with consistent sales
- **Quick Filter Chips** - Easy access to trending products

### For Admin (Inventory Management)
- Quick identification of products that need **priority restocking**
- Better understanding of which products drive **most revenue**
- Data-driven decisions for **purchasing and promotions**

## Rollback

If you need to reset all flags:
```sql
UPDATE public.products 
SET is_runner = false, is_best_seller = false;
```

## Notes

- This is based on **realistic 2025 market trends**
- **Runners** typically change every 6-12 months (new product releases)
- **Best Sellers** are more stable but should be reviewed quarterly
- You can manually adjust flags for specific products in the admin panel
- Consider creating a scheduled job to automatically expire "runner" status after 6 months

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. **Auto-expiry**: Runners automatically become regular products after 6 months
2. **Sales Analytics**: Mark best sellers based on actual sales data
3. **Seasonal Trends**: Mark products as "Back to School" or "Holiday Special"
4. **Admin UI**: Allow admins to toggle these flags without SQL
