# üöÄ Mobile For You Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ Current Status
The application is now running successfully at `http://localhost:3000`!

## üîß What's Working
- ‚úÖ Next.js application is running
- ‚úÖ All pages are accessible (bypassing auth for development)
- ‚úÖ UI components are loading
- ‚úÖ Database connection is configured (needs real API keys)

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Set up Supabase Database
1. Go to your Supabase project: https://wsoaoevzcvuqypvimuee.supabase.co
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `database/schema.sql`
4. Run the SQL to create all tables

### 2. Get Real API Keys

#### Supabase Keys
1. In your Supabase project, go to Settings > API
2. Copy the "anon public" key (replace the placeholder in `.env.local`)
3. Copy the "service_role" key (replace the placeholder in `.env.local`)

#### Clerk Authentication (Optional for now)
1. Go to https://clerk.com and create an account
2. Create a new application
3. Copy the publishable key and secret key
4. Replace the placeholders in `.env.local`

### 3. Update Environment Variables
Edit `.env.local` with your real keys:
```env
# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_real_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_real_secret_here

# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://wsoaoevzcvuqypvimuee.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_real_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_real_service_role_key_here

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Enable Authentication (Optional)
Once you have Clerk keys:
1. Uncomment the auth code in all page files
2. Replace the temporary middleware with the Clerk middleware
3. Restart the server

## üéØ Testing the Application

### Current Features You Can Test:
1. **Dashboard** - Overview of business metrics
2. **Inventory Management** - Add/edit products (will show database errors until Supabase is set up)
3. **Client Management** - Manage client information
4. **Order Management** - Create and track orders
5. **Payment Tracking** - Record payments
6. **Returns Management** - Handle returns and trade-ins
7. **Alerts** - View business alerts

### Test the Health Endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If you see "Invalid API key" errors:
- This is expected until you add real Supabase keys
- The UI will still work, but database operations will fail

### If you see authentication errors:
- The app is currently bypassing auth for development
- Add real Clerk keys to enable authentication

### If the server won't start:
```bash
# Clean and restart
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run dev
```

## üì± Access the Application

Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000**

You should see the Mobile For You dashboard with:
- Business overview cards
- Quick action buttons
- Navigation sidebar
- All major features accessible

## üéâ Success!

Once you complete the Supabase setup, you'll have a fully functional business management system for your mobile device distribution company!
