## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. **Run the Database Migration**

First, you need to run the migration to add the `owner_clerk_id` field to the businesses table:

```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
supabase/migrations/20250121000000_add_business_owners.sql
```

This migration:
- Adds `owner_clerk_id` column to businesses table
- Creates RLS policies so business owners can only edit their own business
- Adds indexes for performance

### 2. **Assign Businesses to Owners**

After a business owner signs up, link their business to their account:

```sql
-- Replace 'user_xxx' with the actual Clerk user ID
-- Replace 'Business Name' with the actual business name

UPDATE public.businesses 
SET owner_clerk_id = 'user_2xyz...' 
WHERE name = 'Tuvia''s Pizza';
```

**To get a user's Clerk ID:**
1. User signs up on DormHub
2. Go to Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí Users
3. Find the user and copy their User ID (starts with `user_`)
4. Run the UPDATE query above
