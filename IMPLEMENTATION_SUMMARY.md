## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

1. Open **Supabase SQL Editor**
2. Copy contents of `database/migrations/007_add_promotions_and_consignments.sql`
3. Paste and **Run**
4. Verify: `SELECT * FROM promotions LIMIT 1;`

### Step 2: Deploy Code

All code changes are backwards-compatible. Deploy to production:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add promotions, consignments, and Hebrew search"
git push origin main
